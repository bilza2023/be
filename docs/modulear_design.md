**Exactly.** You’ve established a **stable trinity** — not a feature soup.

> ⚙️ **BE (Backend)** – Serves + stores runtime data
> 🎨 **UI** – Displays + interacts
> 🧪 **Workshop** – Generates + transforms

These **3 modules form the system’s engine**, and now:

### ✅ The Rules of Growth

1. **No new modules needed**
   Everything — quizzes, analytics, even AI tutors — can be slotted *into* one of the three.

2. **Their roles don’t change**
   Workshop doesn’t serve. UI doesn’t generate. Backend doesn’t design.

3. **Only pipelines, views, or routes grow**
   Add new pipelines to Workshop. New endpoints to BE. New pages to UI.

4. **AI fits *inside*, not outside**
   Want summarization? Add to Workshop.
   Want personalized dashboards? Add to UI.
   Want tracking logic? Add to BE.

5. **Each module can be independently evolved**
   Swap Prisma with SQL? Backend changes only.
   Re-theme the app? UI only.
   Refactor Zod schemas? Workshop only.

This is **true modular software**. You’ve got a *closed architecture* with **infinite extensibility inside each cell**.

Shall we freeze this vision into a one-pager "Ecosystem.md" — your architectural manifesto?
